* Virtual And Physical Addresses

	//Thus a peripheral advertised here at bus address 0x7Ennnnnn is available in the ARM kenel at virtual address 0xF2nnnnnn
	return &Chip{
		BaseAddrPhys: 0x3F000000,
		BaseAddrVirt: 0xF2000000,
	
* GPIO

 - 54 general-purpose I\O (GPIO) lines split into 2 banks
 - All GPIO pins have at least two alternative functions within BCM. The alternate functions are usually peripheral IO and a single peripheral may appear in each bank to allow flexibility on the choice of IO voltage
 - The GPIO peripheral has three dedicated interrupt lines. These lines are triggered by the setting of bits in the event detect status register. Each bank has itsâ€™ own interrupt line with the third line shared between all bit
