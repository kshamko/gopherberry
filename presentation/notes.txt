To greatly simplify, a computer consists of a central processing unit (CPU) attached to memory. The figure above illustrates the general principle behind all computer operations.

---------------------
DMA
Since the speed of devices is far below the speed of processors, there needs to be some way to avoid making the CPU wait around for data from devices.
Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a method of transferring data directly between an peripheral and system RAM.
The driver can setup a device to do a DMA transfer by giving it the area of RAM to put its data into. It can then start the DMA transfer and allow the CPU to continue with other tasks.
Once the device is finished, it will raise an interrupt and signal to the driver the transfer is complete. From this time the data from the device (say a file from a disk, or frames from a video capture card) is in memory and ready to be used.

But why do I have to specify index 0 of the slice?

If you’re familiar with slice internals, you’ll know that a slice is actually a header and a pointer to an underlying array. When converting slice data using unsafe.Pointer, you have to specify the memory address of the first element of the array, not the slice header itself.
